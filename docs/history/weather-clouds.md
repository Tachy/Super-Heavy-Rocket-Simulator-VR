# Weather clouds - history

Superseded states of `docs/subsystems/weather-clouds.md`. Read only when the reasons behind the current design are
needed.

## Task 8 first version (commit 312b7cc, 2026-10-25)

- **Raymarch in a spatial shader**: the full-screen quad itself raymarched at full resolution (first in the
  transparent pass), jitter a PCG hash per pixel and frame (white noise; interleaved gradient noise drew diagonal
  hatching), no temporal accumulation. Measured at the VR preset (terrain_perf, eclipse epoch, ERA5 18:00 pinned):
  p99 13.0 -> 17.4 ms, GPU +4-5 ms on the pad, up to +17 ms ~8 km above a full deck; the per-step fixed cost dominated
  (light samples 4 -> 1 changed little, coarse steps 64 -> 32 saved 3-5 ms). Replaced by the compute cloud pass at 1/2
  resolution with per-eye temporal accumulation (amendment, controller ruling).
- **Hard coverage edges**: in-cloud extinction mean / cf where the shape exceeded the threshold, zero elsewhere. User
  feedback on the first render (tmp/weather_t8_starbase_era5.png of that version): "cotton balls" - flat, uniform
  brightness, hard grainy edges; "Die Ränder sind viel weicher - es liegt am Alpha-Übergang" (MSFS 2024 comparison).
  Replaced by the mean-preserving soft edge ramp.
- **Plane-parallel Sun depth per column**: the TMS term took tau_s from the light march, but the diffuse field was that
  of the column top's incidence mu0 E: cumulus sides facing a low Sun too grey, nothing below the local horizon (no lit
  bases at sunset). Replaced by the entry-surface source (`cloud_scattering_source_3d`).
- **Linear vertical interpolation**: bases rounded like the tops ("cotton balls" from below). Replaced by the vertical
  profile rule (flat bases). Ice cloud had the same shapes as cumulus (the 8 km ice cloud over Starbase on 2024-04-08
  rendered as cotton balls); now thin sheets.
- **Uploads**: one `ImageTexture3D` per snapshot created on the main thread, 49 ms (a VR frame drop at each hour
  change). Replaced by `CloudFieldTexture` (one layer per frame: 5.2 ms per step; two layers took 6.6 ms).

## Task 8 amendment (commits 8161738..1c8bc71, 2026-10-25)

- **Smooth shapes at a distance, uniform edge band**: the shape noise (Perlin gain 0.5, finest octave 500 m) with a
  multiplicative detail factor 1 + a (d - mean) (Worley fBm, tile 2 km) whose amplitude faded linearly to 0 at 30 km
  (desktop) / 15 km (VR); a 100 m edge ramp at the noise's median gradient everywhere. User feedback 2 on
  tmp/weather_t8_starbase_era5.png: low clouds at the horizon had smooth, round, cut-out silhouettes and grainy rims
  ("brauchen weichere Ränder, müssen unregelmäßigere Ränder haben ... echte Alpha-Übergänge"). Replaced in fix round 1
  by the fractal value (Lovejoy's D = 1.35, detail levels band-limited by the pixel footprint) and the edge zone of
  varying width (25-200 m).
- **Temporal weight 0.1** (exponential mean, 23 % of one frame's noise left) and point samples over deep steps
  (grain at bases seen at a grazing angle): replaced by the running mean (floor 1/32) and the step refinement.
- **Sky light without the eclipse** (`atm_sky_light`): the clouds glowed against the darkened scene at 80 % partial
  phase; evaluated per sample the eclipse factor cost ~10 ms at the eclipse epoch, so it is now probed per work group.
- **Column depth conventions**: the point's in-cloud extinction mean / m(cf) against the A channel's mean / cf
  (a step of t_v at the layer centres); now mean / cf in both.
- **Resize**: the result texture was replaced inside the render callback (one renderer error, one frame without
  clouds); now shown by the main thread and freed later.

## Closed-form Sun source as the game's default (Task 8, replaced in Task 8b, 2026-10-25)

- **TMS on the delta-Eddington source function** (`cloud_scattering_source_3d`, still available as the fidelity flag
  `CloudLayer.ScatteringModel.CLOSED_FORM` / `cloud_scattering_model 0`): against the Monte Carlo fixtures forward-
  scattered radiance at a low Sun up to -56 % (Sun 60 deg, view 60 deg forward, tau 10: -44.5 %), the albedo at Sun
  60 deg up to -32 % (tau 1-3), the semi-infinite albedo 0.90 at mu0 0.5 and 1.16 at mu0 0.1; the TMS aureole through
  thick cloud too bright (no IMS). User feedback vs MSFS 2024: no backlit glow, weak silver linings, no inner glow of
  cumuli. Replaced as the default by the Monte Carlo transfer table (Bouthors et al. 2008).
- **First table form** (Task 8b, uncommitted): the table held the whole multiple-scattering source incl. the phase
  function's HG part (g 0.995, a ~0.3 deg peak) with the view ray attenuated by exp(-tau). Tallying the HG part needs
  the radiance within 0.3 deg of every view direction: relative 1-sigma median 1.9 %, p99 55 %, 25-50 % at small
  scattering angles deep in thick slabs (rings around the Sun under a deck) and zeros at tau* 256. Replaced by the
  Draine part with the view ray attenuated by exp(-w_D tau) (median 0.5 %).
- **Performance after Task 8 fix round 1** (closed form, same setup): without clouds p99 13.20 / 13.06 ms, with clouds
  15.54 ms; descent 12.1 -> 16.7 ms p99, worst GPU second 18.9 ms at 8.4 km.

## The cloud pass at long range before Task 10 (fixed 2026-10-26)

- **Step retry on the float32 distance**: a step heavier than `CLOUD_MAX_STEP_WEIGHT` was retried while
  `b - a_this > 1.001 x refined`; far from the camera the float32 difference carries the distance's ulp (1 m at
  8 600 km, 0.25 m at 2 300 km), above the 0.1 % margin of a ~60 m step, so the same step was retried until the
  256-step budget ran out: from the scaled-space limit single rays never reached a deck (speckle; counted per
  pixel: 40-170 of the 256 steps were retries). Now the intended step length is compared.
- **The half-resolution checkerboard's nearest depth on smooth ground**: the nearest of a 2 x 2 block cut the block's
  centre ray short by the block's depth extent (several km for slanted ground seen from 8 600 km): every other
  half-resolution ray lost the clouds within that distance of the ground - a deck at 1-2 km drew with T_bg 0.375 /
  0.625 instead of 0 outside the sub-camera region. Now a block within 5 % in distance takes its mean.
